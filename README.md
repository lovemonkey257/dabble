# dabble
A DAB radio project based on a PI, small LCD and some LED encoders. Very much a work in progress.

## Components
- PI3 or greater. I'm currently using a PI5 which is probably overkill
- [Pimoroni 0.96" LCD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/0-96-spi-colour-lcd-160x80-breakout). I got mine from PiHut.
- 2 x [LED encoders](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rgb-encoder-breakout) although I may change these to ones that include a button. But LEDS....
- RTLSDR (a cheap one will probably do, I'm using an official RTL-SDR.com v3)
- No idea about an enclosure yet. Probably have to 3D print or make out of wood?

## Software
